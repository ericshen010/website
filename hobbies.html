            <h3>Volleyball</h3>
            <p>Volleyball is 100% my favorite sport. I have been playing since the beginning of high school, but unfortunately was only to play 3/4 years because of covid. Nowadays, I try to fit in volleyball when I have the time to play. I definitely play much less volleyball than I used to, but it still remains my favorite sport.</p>

             <h3>Working out</h3>
             <p>Lifting weights has been an important part of my life since quarantine. I started off lifting dumbells at home for exercise, eventually working out with my friends at a gym once Covid got better. Nowadays, I work out multiple times a week at the BRIC (campus gym) and it keeps my mental and physical health in check, so I can succeed in other parts of my life.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I started playing piano when I was very young and practiced and played in rehearsals, competitions, and concerts for about 9 years. Then, as I got older, I developed a liking for Cello more and started to learn that instrument. I have very few opportunities to practice these instruments nowadays at school, but whenever I get the chance I try to revisit these instruments as they bring me a feeling of nostalgia and peace. I also developed a liking for classical music because of it.</p>

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>As a kid, I watched a lot of animes and cartoons. This led me to start sketching my favorite characters from my favorite shows and trying to improve my drawing abilities. Drawing became a huge passion for me and I spent a lot of time honing my skills and watching tutorials online on different art techniques. When I get the chance, I still sketch although I have less time to do so now.

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>From a very young age, I started playing video games with my older brother. We both got more and more into the games, eventually leading to us becoming more competitive and always trying to best each other. I have achieved very high rankings in a couple of games, and want to pursue gaming as a side hobby or career if possible. Below are desciptions of some of my favorite games I have ever played.</p>
            <div class="games">
                 <h4>Hearthstone</h4>
                 <p>I started playing Hearthstone in 7th grade. This game is a card game using characters from a fictional universe, and you climb up the ranked ladder against opponents. I reached rank number 1 in North America on this game and was offered to go professional, however turned down that offer due to my parents not wanting me to do that at the time. If I were to go back in time, I would definitely try to convince them more as that is an experience I feel like I missesd out on.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="games">
            <h4>Fortnite</h4>
            <p>As much as a bad reputation that Fortnite has, I can't deny that this game was a huge part of my fun in high school with my friends. This game is a third person shooter that uses building mechanics to allow you to get cover behind walls and more. I would get home everyday, and finish all my work as soon as possible so I could get on this game with my friends. Although I don't play this game anymore, I have a lot of good memories from this game that I will always remember.</p>

            <h4>Valorant</h4>
            <p>Valorant is a first person shooter with an attacking team and a defending team, and you face off against opponents to rank up. I stopped playing Fortnite around my third year of high school. Around this time, Covid-19 struck the world and everyone was stuck at home with not much to do. During this time, my friends and I played a lot of Valorant and were on discord with each other almost all day. During the time span of quarantine, this game kept my friends and I together and I also hold memories from this time with this game that I will never forget.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="games">
            <h4>League of Legends</h4>
            <p>League of Legends is a game that I started playing when I was very young and still play to this day. It is a 5v5 game on a map where both teams try to take objectives and gain gold over the other team. I originally tried to improve at this game to beat my brother, but over time I grew a passion for the game and improved on my own accord. Today, I am ranked top 125 in North America and have picked up streaming on Twitch alongside that. I hope to do something on the side with this game as getting to this rank is extremely difficult and I believe I could make content that people would enjoy watching.</p>
