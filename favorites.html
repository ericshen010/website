       <p> These are some of my favorite songs at the moment. My favorite songs are always changing around depending on new releases and if I get tired of some songs. I don't have specific reasonings for any of the songs, just that they all make me feel good to listen to and are very catchy.</p>

       <h3>Books</h3>
      
       <h4>Harry Potter</h4>
       <p>The Harry Potter series has always been my absolute favorite book series. I think this series is a good read for all ages and the books set up a universe that is very magical and can entrance anyone that gets into these books. My favorite book out of the seven in the series is the Half-Blood Prince. Overall a great series and would recommend to anyone.</p>
       <h4>Percy Jackson/Gods of Olympus</h4>
       <p>Rick Riordan is one of my all time favorite authors because of these book series he created. Second only to Harry Potter, these fantasy books are such a great read that will keep anyone occupied till you finish the series. This book series also has a lot of Greek mythology in it, and it honestly made me a lot more curious about Greek gods and the lore/legends behind them.</p>

       <h3>Movies</h3>
       <h4>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h4>
       <p>This movie in my opinion has to be one of the most underrated movies of all time. It depicts a story about a man who was born an adult, and dies a baby, with a disease making him age backwards. The story is beautifully written and makes you feel a lot of emotions during different scenes in this man's life.</p>
       <h4>Smile</h4>
       <p>My favorite genre of movies is horror, and Smile is just the best one out there. It is a fairly new movie and it gained a lot of traction because of how well the scary scenes were filmed and acted out. Although I think the ending is a little lacking, I genuinely haven't been this scared watching a horror movie in a long time, or even ever.</p>

       <h3>TV shows/Animes</h3>
       <h4>Dark</h4>
       <p>I started this show just this summer with my brother when we were in Tahoe. It is an amazingly good thriller/mystery show that revolves around time travel and how it affects a small town in Germany. This show had me hooked all three seasons and the plot is just unbelievable that it is worth a rewatch just to catch the small details that slipped by the first time watching. Amazing tv show.</p>
       <h4>Naruto</h4>
       <p>I love anime, my all time favorite childhood anime is Naruto. This show gives me a nostalgic feel everytime I rewatch parts of it or clips, and always is enjoyable to watch. The story revolves around a boy in a world of ninjas, and his progression through the struggles of life.</p>
